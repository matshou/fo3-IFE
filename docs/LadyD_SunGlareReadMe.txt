*TESTED WITH HDR LIGHTING ONLY* May not work with others.
If anyone knows how to get these to work with the other lighting effects, please let me know. I'd really appreciate that very much.

Description
===========
This is a subtle, atmospheric effect of the sun's glare so that when you move your view, there is a nice twinkling effect in the sky the way the real sun does. 
It's a nice change from the original game's sun. :)

Another variation on the sunglare.
Enjoy!
